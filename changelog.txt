  * GHost++ will try to determine whether your database schema needs to be upgraded or not when it starts
  * if your database schema is out of data GHost++ will automatically upgrade it
 - completely rewrote game.cpp to allow for admin games
 - did some spring cleaning on some classes to make for cleaner and neater code
 - bot_synclimit defaults to 30 now instead of 15
 - added new config value admingame_create to control whether to create the admin game or not
 - added new config value admingame_port to control the admin game port
 - added new config value admingame_password to control the admin game password
 - fixed a bug where GHost++ sent the map width instead of the map height when broadcasting a game to the local network
 - added 10 new entries to language.cfg
 - modified lang_0093 slightly

Version 8.1
 - updated StormLib to version 6.23
  * backported all my previous modifications to StormLib so it should stil compile and run properly on Linux systems
  * made a few more modifications to StormLib to make my changes cleaner and more understandable
  * as a result of this StormLib once again uses the system copy of zlib under Linux instead of a local copy
  * StormLib should now correctly load the Warlock 083 map
 - finally wrote some code to check all commands for correct input
  * e.g. if you try to run the command "!swap 1 x" or "!swap 1"
  * if bad input is detected a warning will be printed to the server console
 - the !close command can now take more than one input (e.g. "!close 6 7 8")
 - the !open command can now take more than one input (e.g. "!open 6 7 8")
 - the bot now attempts to send the "game created" chat message to the channel *before* creating the game
  * if it can't because of flood protection it won't send the chat message at all
  * this doesn't apply if you whispered the bot since whispers work even when in a game
 - fixed a ton of problems related to observers in melee maps
  * GHost++ now enforces player limits when observers are permitted
  * GHost++ does not enforce player limits with computer slots
 - the !compteam command now uses correct team numbers (previously you had to use team 0 for team 1 and so on)
 - added new config value map_numplayers to control the number of players in melee maps (no effect in custom maps)
 - added new config value map_numteams to control the number of teams in melee maps (no effect in custom maps)
  * in most (all?) cases this should be the same as map_numplayers
 - GHost++ now automatically adds observer slots to maps when observers are permitted (including custom maps)

Version 8.01
 - modified StormLib so that it should compile and run properly on more Linux systems now (including 64 bit systems)
 - GHost++ now uses the StormLib headers from the StormLib directory rather than seperate copies

Version 8.0
 - switched from libmpq to StormLib for MPQ loading
   * libmpq was unable to deal with several map protection schemes and would even segfault (crash) when loading some maps
   * StormLib can handle more map protection schemes (but not all - for example, Warlock 083 doesn't load properly)
 - added support for automatically calculating map_width, map_height, and map_slot<x> (the slot structure)
 - added support for game rehosting via the !priv and !pub commands in the game lobby
   * this doesn't work very well with automatic spoof checking in public games at the moment
 - added support for the lag screen
   * the lag screen is controlled by the sync limit
   * if a player falls behind by more than the sync limit number of packets the lag screen will be started
   * when the player catches up to within half the sync limit number of packets they will be removed from the lag screen
 - added new config value bot_pingduringdownloads to control whether the bot should stop pinging *all* players when at least one player is downloading
 - added new config value bot_refreshmessages to control whether refresh messages are displayed by default (use !refresh to change this for a particular game)
 - added new config value bot_synclimit to control the default sync limit (use !synclimit to change this for a particular game)
 - added new command !drop to drop all lagging players (players listed on the lag screen)
 - added new command !synclimit to change the sync limit for a particular game
 - game descriptions now include the game time in minutes (when using !getgame/!getgames)
 - the !channel command now uses "/join" instead of "/j" so it should work on PVPGN servers now
 - the !exit and !quit commands can now only be accessed by the root admin
 - the !exit and !quit commands will now alert you if there is a game in the lobby or in progress (add force to skip this check)
 - the !latency command now returns the current latency setting if no latency is specified
 - the !sp command now shuffles players only (it leaves open/closed/computer slots in place)
 - added some additional console messages during startup to help identify problems when connecting to PVPGN servers
 - added 10 new entries to language.cfg

Version 7.0
 - optimized loading of the iptocountry data, it should load somewhat faster now
 - added support for automatically calculating map_size, map_info, and map_crc
  * a big thank you to Strilanc for figuring out the map_crc algorithm
  * see the new "Map Config Files" section of this readme for much more information on this
 - GHost++ now requires libmpq
  * libmpq requires zlib
  * libmpq requires libbz2
  * Windows users never fear - I have included all the necessary include files and prebuilt libraries
  * Linux users are in for a bit more effort - you'll need to download and compile libmpq and possibly zlib and libbz2 yourself
  * note that I had to modify libmpq slightly to make it compile with Visual C++ (the modified project is found in the included libmpq-0.4.2-win.zip if you want to compile it yourself)
 - added ms_stdint.h for standard types across all these libraries with Visual C++
  * bncsutil now uses ms_stdint.h when compiling with Visual C++

Version 6.2

- updated SQLite to SQLite 3.6.3
- slightly modified the welcome message sent when a player joins the game
- added new command !from to display the country each player is from
- the iptocountry data is loaded from the file "ip-to-country.csv" on startup
 * a big thank you to tjado for help with the iptocountry feature
 * the included ip-to-country.csv is the September 1, 2008 data from http://ip-to-country.webhosting.info/
 * it may take a few seconds to load the iptocountry data when you start ghost++ (it takes ~10 seconds on my 3.2 GHz P4)
- fixed a bug where config files with very long lines could cause ghost++ to fail
- fixed some crash bugs where ghost++ could crash if the database schema is not what ghost++ expects

Version 6.1

- stats are now displayed for players who didn't spoof check when using !stats and !statsdota
- the bot now automatically broadcasts the game to the local network on port 6112 every 5 seconds when hosting a game
- when joining a game from the LAN screen after receiving a broadcast or a !sendlan packet you should no longer be disconnected after the game fills up
- player leave codes are now sent when a player leaves the game (only "player lost" and "player disconnected" codes)
- fixed a bug with printing ingame chat messages to the console
- fixed a bug where players downloading the map could still be kicked for excessive pings

Version 6.0

- rewrote the internal map handling code
  * map.cfg and all other map configuration files are now stored in another directory
  * you can't load maps while a game is in the lobby anymore
  * unfortunately the configuration files are still necessary because the bot doesn't parse the maps (yet)
- added support for non custom games
  * this is only barely tested so there may be some bugs
  * added support for changing your team/colour/race/handicap
  * if you allow observers/referees the bot doesn't ensure the correct player totals so it's possible to have more players than a map supports
  * if you choose random races the race box isn't greyed out but the bot won't allow you to change your race anyway
- added new config value bot_mapcfgpath
- added new config value map_speed
- added new config value map_visibility
- added new config value map_observers
- added new config value map_flags
- added new config value map_gametype
- removed config value map_custom (it's replaced by map_observers)
- when creating a private game on a PVPGN server the bot stays in the game rather than returning to the chat channel immediately
- the bot now discards pings from players who are downloading the map (since those pings are probably inaccurate)
- ingame chat messages are now printed to the server console (only messages sent to all players, allied and private chat is not printed)
- the bot now checks that everyone has the map before starting the game when using !start (use !start force to skip this check)
- removed some useless messages when using !start
- when playing a map with dota stats player deaths will be printed to the console just for fun
- added UDP socket support as a first step to supporting LAN functions
- added new command !refresh to enable or disable refresh messages (every game starts with refresh messages enabled by default)
- added new command !comp to add a computer player to the game
- added new command !compcolour to change a computer's colour
- added new command !comphandicap to change a computer's handicap
- added new command !comprace to change a computer's race
- added new command !compteam to change a computer's team
- added new command !sendlan to send a fake LAN message to another computer
  * in order to use this the player needs to be running Warcraft 3 and waiting at the LAN screen
  * when you type !sendlan <ip> [port] the game will appear on the player's LAN screen and can be joined directly
  * the player needs to have forwarded the correct port on their router for this to work
  * upon joining the game the bot will reveal that you are using a name spoofer which is more or less true and thus will not be disabled
- added 4 new entries to language.cfg

Version 5.1

- added includes for stdlib.h, string.h, and algorithm to fix some compile issues on some platforms
- GHost++ now pipelines up to 70 KB of map data to the player for even faster map downloads (the theoretical throughput is [70 KB * 1000 / ping] in KB/sec)
- GHost++ no longer autokicks reserved players for excessive pings
- added new command !privby to host a private game by a player other than yourself
- added new command !pubby to host a public game by a player other than yourself
- the !delban and !unban commands no longer work in the game lobby or in the game (they can still be used in battle.net via local chat or by whispering the bot)
- when using !privby and !pubby the specified owner is granted access to the admin commands available in the lobby and in the game but NOT in battle.net unless they're an admin
- when creating a private game the bot now returns to the battle.net chat channel immediately rather than waiting until the game starts
- added support for printing total wins and total losses to the !statsdota command
- modified language.cfg to include total wins and total losses when printing dota stats

Version 5.0 Beta 1

- fixed a potential infinite loop with the language code
- added support for map downloads
- GHost++ does not use map files for anything except sending the raw data to the player so the map config files are still necessary although this may change in the future
- GHost++ pipelines up to 28 KB of map data to the player before waiting for confirmation packets so map downloads should go very quickly if you and the receiving player have fast connections
- GHost++ sends map data to every player that requests it simulataneously (there is no limit of 1 or 2 players at a time like in Warcraft 3)
- the virtual host "GHost" in the lobby will now be created even when the map has 12 slots
 * this is necessary because the bot can't send maps to players without a valid PID and we can't be guaranteed the lobby will have another player (or that Warcraft 3 will accept a forged PID)
 * this is untested and may cause Warcraft 3 to do something weird when a map with 12 slots fills up with real players which is why this is a beta release
- added new config value bot_mappath to specify the directory where GHost++ will look for map files (it tries to open [bot_mappath + map_localpath] when looking for the map)
- added new config value bot_allowdownloads to specify whether to allow map downloads or not
- added new config value map_localpath
- added new command !sp to shuffle all the players in the game lobby
- added new command !muteall to mute global chat in game
- added new command !unmuteall to unmute global chat in game
- you can now access the !stats and !statsdota commands in battle.net via local chat or by whispering the bot (as with !version the bot will only respond if there are few messages already in the chat queue)
- added 3 new entries to language.cfg

Version 4.3

- added a socket timeout function to automatically kick players who stop responding for 30 seconds (this doesn't include truly AFK players as their computer will send keepalive packets)

Version 4.2

- fixed a bug where some players would sometimes not be saved to the database when a DotA game ended
- if you were using version 4 or version 4.1 and you played at least one DotA game your database may be missing some players
- modified the !version command to only respond to non admins when there are few messages already in the chat queue to prevent malicious users from abusing the bot
- the !end command no longer works in the game lobby - it's intended to be used to end a currently running game (use !unhost to end a game in the lobby)
- you can now access the !stats and !statsdota commands more than once per game but only once every 5 seconds to prevent spamming
- you can now add a player name after the !stats and !statsdota commands to get statistics about another player (leave it blank to get your own statistics)

Version 4.1

- fixed a crash bug when using !stats and !statsdota
- two minor cosmetic changes to language.cfg

Version 4

- updated SQLite to SQLite 3.6.1
- included the SQLite source code to help eliminate some linking errors, no more SQLite shared objects required on Linux
- added languages support (console messages are still hardcoded in english)
- included an english language.cfg
- GHost++ now sends pings during map loading to help prevent players from timing out during map loading
- admins are now automatically treated as reserved players when joining a game
- the !version command now sends the version number to admins
- the !version command can now be accessed by non admins, however it does not send the version number to non admins (this can be changed in language.cfg)
- added support for basic game/player statistics such as total games played (these stats are collected no matter which map is played)
- added support for map specific game/player statistics (these stats are collected only on some maps)
- included a DotA statistics class to record DotA specific statistics using the new real time replay data in dota 6.54
- added new config value map_type to specify which statistics class handles the map statistics (currently "dota" is the only supported type, set it to anything else to disable)
- added new command !stats which any player can access which displays basic player statistics
- added new command !statsdota which any player can access which displays DotA player statistics
- added new command !end
- added some more console messages to help with troubleshooting (some of the old error messages were pretty vague)
- a console message will now be printed when a player is kicked because they don't have the map

Version 3

- ghost now works on systems with 64 bit processors
- if you have a 64 bit processor and you want to compile ghost yourself you will need to recompile bncsutil because one of the 64 bit fixes was in bncsutil
- ghost now works with maps other than DotA
- the default map is now DotA 6.54b if no map.cfg file is found
- added new config value map_custom
- added new config value map_width to allow for maps other than DotA
- added new config value map_height to allow for maps other than DotA

- added new command !load and !map
- added new command !a (as an alias to !abort)
- removed command !privobs (observers are now specified in the map config file)
- removed command !pubobs (observers are now specified in the map config file)
- added some more console messages to help understand what the bot is doing
- fixed a bug where changing your team or slot wouldn't work properly for maps other than DotA
- fixed a bug where maps with more or less than 10 player (non observer) slots wouldn't load
- fixed a bug where an extra comma would sometimes be added to the ping text when using !ping
- the config files are now in <LF> format instead of <CR/LF>
- included a DotA 6.54b map file
- included a DotA 6.54b with observers map file
- included a Warlock 081b map file

Version 2

- the makefile now creates a "ghost++" binary instead of "ghost" so you can copy it to the parent directory without any trouble
- ghost now tries to shutdown properly when you press Ctrl-C, press it again to force it to exit immediately
- changed config key from bot_rootadmin to db_rootadmin
- added new config key bnet_custom_war3version (set it to 21 for version 1.21 or 22 for version 1.22)
- added SQLite 3 database support
- added new command !addadmin
- added new command !checkadmin
- added new command !countadmins
- added new command !deladmin

- assorted minor bug fixes

Version 1

- initial release
